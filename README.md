          This is 28-70's first git project!

          Like it is said, this is my first project. I would like to thank all that has helped in my progress to my goals of becoming a developer. I have always been interested in programming and computers, and it has taken a long time for me to get to the point that I would like to now start programming. I have been programming for CNC Machines for about 25 - 30 years, but that is another type of programming. Now I would like to take it to a new level, and get into development.

          Web development and software development is something that I am interested in. These are the subjects that I will be focusing on as my studies.So I will be moving forward with my studies and also see what kind of projects that I may get involved with.
